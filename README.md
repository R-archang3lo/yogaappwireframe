Medium-fidelity wireframe created as a project of the UX Designer Training at DIO.

Potential product: a yoga app with video classes to practise from anywhere, containing different modalities and guided meditation. 
I only developed the ‘Classes’ page of the service. This page contains: Home, Search, Classes and Profile buttons, Class Options button, Carousel icon, Images and Video.
This is a fictitious project that was developed for an activity in the course ‘Jornada UX Designer’, by Professor Rodrigo Alexandre, on the DIO study platform.
